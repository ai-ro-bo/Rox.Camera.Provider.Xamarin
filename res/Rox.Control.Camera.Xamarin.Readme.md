### Android

In your Android project "MainActivity" code file, you must call "Rox.Camera.Init(Activity)" before "Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init()". It should look something like:

```csharp
    global::Rox.Camera.Init(this);

    global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();

    LoadApplication(new MyCameraApplication());
```

### iOS

In your iOS project "AppDelegate" code file, you must call "CameraControlApple.Initialise()" before "Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init()". It should look something like:

```csharp
    global::Rox.Camera.Init();

    global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();

    LoadApplication(new MyCameraApplication());
```
